The code is filled with strange type definitions like DWORD_PTR and LPRECT, and variables have names like hWnd and pwsz (called Hungarian notation). It's worth taking a moment to learn some of the Windows coding conventions.  The vast majority of Windows APIs consist of either functions or Component Object Model (COM) interfaces. Very few Windows APIs are provided as C++ classes. (A notable exception is GDI+, one of the 2-D graphics APIs.)","","","",""

Certainly you hope that many customers will find and install your app, and also leave ratings and reviews. The Store dashboards will also give you information like average app usage per day with comparisons to other apps in your category, quality reports (crash dumps, unresponsive events, and exceptions), ratings and reviews, adoption rates, download history, in-app purchases, and app sales. More details, including how to enable certain data collection, is found on Collecting telemetry data from your apps. Third party providers such as Distimo and AppFeds also produce Store-wide analytics, which is very valuable for tracking overall market trends and activities.   -->"However, none of this really tells you about users’ specific activity within the app itself."  Such activity cannot be generalized or collected automatically. Collecting that data is the purpose of instrumenting your app from the inside for telemetry and analytics.   ","","","",""
